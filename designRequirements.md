## Design Requirements:

This application was built with the following the design requirements for a course assessment in application design.

- Application handles all categories of errors gracefully.
- Uses variables by declaring and assigning all values correctly, and uses appropriate syntax or language features to implement variable scope in all appropriate blocks of code.
- Uses loops and conditional control structures to implement a control flow which has multiple paths and complex nested structures that handle multiple contingencies that manage the control flow of the application in a highly efficient manner
- Correctly imports four or more relevant external libraries into the code.
- Makes extensive use of functions from one or more external libraries.
- Writes six or more simple functions and them in code.
- Writes three or more classes, uses inheritance and composition in at least two classes, and uses these classes appropriately in code.
- Uses input and output in two or more sophisticated ways within an application to
enhance the user experience of the application with relevant functionality.
- Applies DRY coding principles to entire codebase
- Applies code style and convention consistently across all code produced with no breaches of the used code styles or conventions.
- Help file includes comprehensive instructions which accurately describe:
    - steps to install the application; 
    - dependencies required by the application; 
    - system/hardware requirements; 
    - features of the application.
- Meets D requirement, and provides correct information about how the licences of
the third-party software used by the project is or is not ethical.
