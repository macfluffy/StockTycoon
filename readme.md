Stock Tycoon is a text based stocks drafting game. Players compete against AI to put together the most valuable portfolio!

This package contains the following scripts:
1. draftingGame.py - This is the game script. Run this to play the game. This script is a top level script showing how the game flows.
2. classes.py, stockCatalogue.py, & botNames.py - These are vital for the game to run properly.
    classes.py:
        This contains all the class templates called in the draftingGame script. This would be the main engine to the game.

    stockCatalogue.py:
